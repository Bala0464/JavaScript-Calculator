Calculator using JavaScript - Requirements Document**

**1. Introduction:**
   - The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for developing a simple calculator using JavaScript.
   - The calculator will provide basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   
**2. Features:**
   - **Display:** 
     - The calculator will have a display area where the input and output will be shown.
   - **Buttons:**
     - AC: Clears the display.
     - DE: Deletes the last character in the display.
     - Decimal Point (.): Adds a decimal point to the display.
     - Numeric Buttons (0-9): Input numbers to the display.
     - Operators (+, -, *, /): Perform arithmetic operations.
     - Equal (=): Computes the result of the expression entered in the display.
   
**3. User Interface:**
   - The calculator will have a clean and user-friendly interface.
   - The layout will consist of rows and columns of buttons arranged logically.
   - The display area will be prominently placed at the top to show input and output.
   
**4. Functionality:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - Users can input numbers and operators by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
     - The display will update dynamically as the user inputs numbers and operators.
   - **Arithmetic Operations:**
     - The calculator will perform arithmetic operations based on user input.
     - It will support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - **Clearing and Deleting:**
     - The AC button will clear the display, resetting it to an empty state.
     - The DE button will delete the last character in the display.
   - **Evaluation:**
     - Pressing the equal (=) button will evaluate the expression entered in the display and show the result.
     - The calculator will use JavaScript's `eval()` function to compute the result of the expression.
   
**5. Design Considerations:**
   - **Responsive Design:**
     - The calculator will be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
   - **Styling:**
     - Styling will be done using CSS to enhance the visual appeal and user experience.
   - **Error Handling:**
     - The calculator will handle errors gracefully, such as division by zero or invalid input.
   
**6. Implementation Plan:**
   - **Frontend Development:**
     - Develop the HTML structure for the calculator layout.
     - Implement CSS styling for the visual design.
     - Integrate JavaScript for the calculator's functionality.
   - **Testing:**
     - Conduct thorough testing to ensure all features work as expected.
     - Test for edge cases and error handling scenarios.
   - **Deployment:**
     - Deploy the calculator to a web server or hosting platform for public access.
   
**7. Conclusion:**
   - The calculator will provide users with a simple yet efficient tool for performing basic arithmetic operations.
   - It will be accessible via web browsers on various devices, making it convenient for users to perform calculations on the go.
